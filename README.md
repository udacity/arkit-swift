# Swift ARKit Foundations

This repository contains sample applications and resources to demonstrate concepts taught in Udacity's Swift ARKit Foundations course. Each application contains a starter project to be used to follow along the videos, as well as a solution project (i.e. the state of the project after following along a video).

The videos with projects are:
